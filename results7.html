<font size="+1">The charts on this page show how career advancement affects federal and state budgets by increasing tax revenue and decreasing public assistance expenditures. As workers' income increases, they pay more in taxes. These gains can increase government revenue. These workers also typically receive less financial support from public assistance programs, which can reduce government spending. The net effect of the gain in taxes and the decline in public assistance spending is referred to as <strong>net taxes</strong>.
