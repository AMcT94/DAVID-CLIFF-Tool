  Finally, let's bring it all together. The chart below shows a family's 'net financial resources' over time. Net financial resources are family take-home pay, plus public assistance, minus the Minimum Household Budget. When net financial resources are above $0 (the Break-Even Line), it means that income and public assistance together provide enough to cover basic expenses.

If net resources decline, the worker may face a benefits cliff. If net resources are flat, the worker may face a benefits plateau. See the FAQ tab for definitions of benefit cliffs and plateaus.
