    The Minimum Household Budget includes seven basic expenses: child care, food, health care, housing (rent and utilities), transportation, technology and miscellaneous expenses. Health insurance includes out-of-pocket costs and employer-sponsored insurance premiums. These expenses change with time and depend on factors like the number and ages of children and geographic differences in cost of living. The Minimum Household Budget also includes taxes, which are not shown here because taxes are taken out of income in the graph above. For additional information about the Minimum Household Budget, please see the methodology section.
