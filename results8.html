The chart below shows short-term (1-3 years), medium-term (1-5 and 1-10 years) and long-term (lifetime) gains or losses to the government (federal and state) that arise when switching from the comparison occupation to the target occupation. The gains or losses in the chart reflect the difference in net taxes between the careers, calculated as taxes received minus the public assistance disbursements.
